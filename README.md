## My process

As always, I work with a mobile first workflow.
- After analyzing the design patterns for both desktop and mobile, I build out the structure using html.
- I have also started using root variables in all my projects so i created a custom css snippet that has all variables needed in my projects
- The next step is to lay out the styling for the mobile design
- After mobile design, I add breakpoints for my desktop design using media queries
and add the styles for larger screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have really learned alot in this challenge.
- First thing, i have learned how to set background patterns to your designs
- I have also learned how to use the z-index property
- I have learned how to properly use transform property in css and z-index
- Lastly, I have learned to use an appreciate the awesome power of css

### Continued development
